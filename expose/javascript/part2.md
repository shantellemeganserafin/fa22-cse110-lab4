1. 3 will be printed. i incremented to 3 after the for loop. Var is global.
2. 150 will be printed, the last discountedPrice after the for loop. Var is global.
3. 150 will be printed, the last finalPrice after the for loop. Var is global.
4. [50, 100, 150] the array "discounted" with the final discounted prices for each item in prices. Var is global.
5. Error, i is out of scope after the for loop it was declared in due to let declared in the block.
6. Error, discountedPrice is out of scope after the for loop it was declared in due to let declared in the block.
7. 150 will be printed, let discounted was declared at the beginning of the function and is global.
8. [50, 100, 150] the array "discounted" with the final discounted prices for each item in prices is returned because discounted was was declared at the beginning of the function and is global.
9. Error, i is out of scope after the for loop it was declared in due to let declared in the block.
10. 3, will be printed. Const length was declared at the beginning of the function and is global.

    A.  student.name
    B.  student['Grad year'])
    C.  student.greeting
    D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name)
    E. student.courseLoad[0]
13. 
    A.  32 - integer 2 maps to string 2, thus '3' + 2 = 32
    B.  1 - string 3 maps to int 3 - 2 = 1.
    C. 3, null maps to int 0
    D. 3null - null as a string is null + 3 is concatenated.
    E. 4, true is mapped to 1 as an int plus 3 = 4
    F. 0, false and null are both mapped to 0 as an int
    G. 3undefined, undefined maps to string undefined concatenated with 3
    H. NaN, undefined as a number is NaN, 3 - NaN = NaN
14. aj
    A. True - int value of string 2 is 2
    B. False - 2 and 12 are treated lexicographically. 12 > 2
    C. True - 2 is mapped to '2' as a string
    D. False - 2 and '2' are not hte same types
    E. False - True as mapped to 1 as an int
    F. True - Boolean(2) is True
15. == is comparision using type conversion === is a strict comparison without type conversion
16. See file
17. newArr 2,4,6 is returne. 1) do something is called and using 1,2,3 as an input, it will alter the input as 246. 2) modifyArray is called, modifyArray calls callback (do something) using the updated array during each iteration and returns the newarray
